# GPR35-long-transcriptomics

Here we provide the the code used to perform differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis in GPR35 overexpressing and knockout cell lines to study GPR35 long isoform actitivty.
Our study investigated GPR35 long isoform signaling acitivty and its relevance in colorecatl cancer.

Raw fastq files has been uploaded to the european nucleotide archive (ENA) with the project identifier PRJEB101778

Metadata file for GPR35 knockout analysis in Caco-2 is supplied. File path column to load data have to bee added. Metadata for GPR35 overexpression in HEK293 is included in the DGE file. Column with filepaths will have to bee added.
