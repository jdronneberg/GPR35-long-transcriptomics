# GPR35-long-transcriptomics

Here we provide the the code used to perform differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis in GPR35 overexpressing and knockout cell lines to study GPR35 long isoform actitivty.
Our study investigated GPR35 long isoform signaling acitivty and its relevance in colorecatl cancer.
